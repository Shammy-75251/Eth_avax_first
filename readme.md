## **ErrorHandling Contract**
## **Project Title**
ErrorHandling Contract - A Demonstration of Error Handling in Solidity

## Description
This contract provides a basic implementation of error handling in Solidity using require, assert, and revert statements. It includes a function to check input values and throw errors based on specified conditions. The contract demonstrates best practices for ensuring input validation and internal consistency.

## Getting Started
Installing
To use this contract, you need to have a compatible Ethereum development environment set up. Here are the installation steps:

Install an Ethereum development framework such as Truffle or Hardhat.
Set up a local Ethereum development network or connect to a testnet/mainnet.
Executing Program
To run the program and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

Download the source code of the contract to your local environment.
Compile the contract using the appropriate command in your Ethereum development framework.
Deploy the compiled contract to your Ethereum network of choice.
Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using the available functions.

Install Ethereum development framework (e.g., Truffle or Hardhat).
Set up a local Ethereum development network or connect to a testnet/mainnet.
Download the contract source code.
Compile the contract using the Ethereum development framework's command.
Deploy the compiled contract to your Ethereum network.
Interact with the contract using the available functions.

## How to Use
To use this contract, follow these steps:
Deploy the ErrorHandling contract on a compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Once deployed, you can access the public function:
checkValue: Call this function to check the value and handle errors based on the conditions specified in the function.

## Example Usage
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8;
contract ErrorHandling {
    function checkValue(uint256 value) external pure returns (bool) {
        // Using require statement
        require(value > 10, "Value must be greater than 10");

        // Using assert statement
        uint256 result = value * 2;
        assert(result >= value);

        // Using revert statement
        if (value == 56) {
            revert("The value cannot be 56");
        }

        return true;
    }
}
In this example, we deploy the contract and call the checkValue function with different values to see how error handling works:
